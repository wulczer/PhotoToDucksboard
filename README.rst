=====================
 Photo to Ducksboard
=====================

A simple Android app that sends any photo to a Ducksboard custom widget.

Usage
=====

After installing, sign in to your Ducksboard account by providing the API key
or the username and password. Once you've done that, you'll be able to use the
Photo to Ducksboard option from the share image menu to send that image to any
custom image widget on any one of your dashboards.

Disclaimer
==========

This is my first ever Android app and my Java is a bit rusty. The code quality
might be preposterous.

Tested on a SG2 with a nightly CyanogenMod 9 build. Should work on other
Android versions and phones.
